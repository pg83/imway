# Every instrumented process (the compositor and each test client) drops a
# profile into the profile dir. Binary-id file naming proved unstable across
# link/exec flavors, so they all land together and llvm-cov maps records
# through the function hashes present in imway_test. What cannot come along
# is a profile that was never finished being written: see the merge below.
